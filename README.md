# First-Person Controller for Unity

> A First-Person Controller for Unity.

> ðŸ§ª **EXPERIMENTAL** This project is experimental. It is still under development, so it may be unstable. It is not optimized and is largely untested. Do **not** use this project in critical projects.

This package includes a First-Person Controller for Unity. Check out the [Features](#features) section for a detailed list of all features of the controller. The footage below shows the open-source sample project ["Mapper's Peak"](https://github.com/dyrdadev/mappers-peak) using the First-Person Controller.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the First Person Controller:** Install this package as described [below](#install-the-package).
2. **Install UniRx:** The package depends on [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx). Unfortunately, this dependency cannot be included automatically; the reason is described below in the ["Special Dependencies"](#unirx) section. You have to include UniRx in your project. UniRx is available [as UPM package](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx#upm-package) or you can import it [from the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unirx-reactive-extensions-for-unity-17276).
3. **Update to Unity's new Input System** This package uses Unity's [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.inputsystem.html) package. When asked from Unity, update to Unity's new Input System. Alternatively, you can implement your own ```FirstPersonControllerInput``` class and ignore the existing PlayerInput folder.
4. **Explore your scene:** Add the "FirstPersonPlayer" prefab from the package to your scene. Now you can explore your scene with the First-Person Controller.

## Install the Package

I recommend **installing this package from a Git URL using the Package Manager window.** This involves the following steps:

1. Open the Package Manager window in your Unity editor (Window âžœ Package Manager)
2. Click "+" in the upper left corner âžœ "Add package from git URL" 
3. Enter the Git URL of the latest release: ```https://github.com/dyrdadev/first-person-controller-for-unity.git#0.0.4``` and click "Add"

> You can find more information [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).


## Special Dependencies

## UniRx

The controller depends on [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx). UniRx is the implementation of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) for Unity. Unfortunately, it is not possible to add it as a dependency because Unity doesnâ€™t support Git URLs for indirect dependencies. UniRx has to be installed manually in your project that uses the First Person Controller. UniRx is available [as UPM package](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx#upm-package) or you can import it [from the Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/unirx-reactive-extensions-for-unity-17276).

If you want to learn UniRx to extend the controller or use it for other components, I recommend the tutorial series ["ReactiveX and Unity3D"](https://javadocmd.com/blog/reactivex-unity3d-part-1/) by Tyler Coles. Also check out the official material of [UniRx](https://github.com/neuecc/UniRx) and [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/).

## Input System Package

The project includes player input and uses Unity's new [Input System Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.inputsystem.html). The new system replaces the classic input system with the Input Manager in ```UnityEngine.Input```. On import, Unity asks you if your project should be updated to the new Input System. If you need the ```UnityEngine.Input``` input system, you can set the "Active Input Handling" option in the Player settings (Project Settings âžœ Player âžœ Other Settings) to ```Both```. Then you can use the new Input System Package System and the old Input Manager with the ```UnityEngine.Input``` class.

If you do not want to switch to the new input system, you can implement your own ```FirstPersonControllerInput``` class that uses the input system of your choice.

## Features

### Support of Various Input Devices

The First-Person Controller supports a mouse + keyboard input scheme and a gamepad input scheme. You can edit the input schemes and add new ones in the "FirstPersonInputAction" Input Action Asset. Check out the [manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.2/Documentation/Manual/com.unity.inputsystem.html) of the Input System for further information.

### Full Locomotion

The First-Person Controller implements physics-based locomotion allowing you to move around, run, and jump.

### Character Effects

The controller implements an ```ICharacterSignals``` interface for character effects such as character audio or camera effects. The interface offers you an easy way to implement your own effects. The package currently includes the following effects, which are already implemented:

- **Head Bob** The package includes an optional head-bob effect for walking and running. The effect moves the camera slightly up and down to simulate the movement.
- **Sound Effects** The package includes an optional component for sound effects of the character.

## Special Thanks

This project was inspired by the tutorial series ["ReactiveX and Unity3D"](https://javadocmd.com/blog/reactivex-unity3d-part-1/) by Tyler Coles. Many approaches of this tutorial series inspired features of this project. And the tutorial is what introduced me to Reactive Programming in Unity in the first place. I recommend checking out the tutorial series.
